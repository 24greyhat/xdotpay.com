# 🚀 **Xdopay Compliance Statement**

### 🟩 We Are **Not a VASP**  
**Xdopay is a fully non-custodial payment protocol.**  
We **never hold**, **control**, or **intermediate** user funds.  
All payments flow **directly from payer → merchant wallet**.

---

### 🔗 **Smart-Contract Fee Routing**  
Our protocol fees are collected **automatically** via an on-chain  
**smart-contract fee-split**, where merchants pre-approve the fee.  
The contract **routes the fee** directly to the protocol wallet —  
**no custody, no handling, no intervention** by Xdopay.

---

### 🛡️ **Pure Software. Zero Financial Intermediation.**  
Xdopay provides **software tools**, not financial services.  
We do **not** operate as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP)  
under any custodial, exchange, remittance, or brokerage definition.

---

**✨ 100% Non-Custodial • On-Chain • Transparent • Compliant**
