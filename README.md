# 🟩 Xdopay — Non-Custodial • Open Source • Not a VASP

### 💡 Open-Source Software  
Xdopay is an **open-source, non-custodial payment protocol**.  
Anyone can run the code — we do **not operate a custodial service**.

### 🔐 Zero Custody  
We never hold or control private keys, wallets, or user funds.  
Payments occur **directly between payer and merchant wallets**.

### 🔗 Smart-Contract Fee Splits  
Protocol fees are collected automatically by an auditable  
**on-chain fee-split smart contract**, routing a predefined  
merchant-approved fee directly to the protocol address.

### 🛡️ Not a Virtual Asset Service Provider  
Xdopay provides **software**, not financial services.  
We do **not** provide custody, exchange, remittance, settlement,  
or any regulated Virtual Asset Service under UAE frameworks.
